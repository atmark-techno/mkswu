# tar format changed in 1.35 so depending on version hash got updated:

# "This avoids generating irrelevant differences which helps with reproducible builds"...
# so even with tar reproducibility improvements in mkswu we cannot use
# swdesc_files here reliably, but swdesc_tar doesn't actually check we
# give it a tar, just use that directly.

# avoid compression so file is > 512k

4.6
===
fixes:
 - /!\ mkswu --init would incorrectly enable auto-updates even when disabled
during the question /!\
This was broken since 4.3 (included), if you have generated a new mkswu
config with mkswu 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5 and did not want autoupdate please:
    - remove autoupdate lines from initial_setup.desc and regenerate its swu
    - disable swupdate-url service on armadillo with the following mkswu
    command:
        swdesc_command 'rc-update del swupdate-url default'
    or directly on armadillo:
        persist_file -dv /etc/runlevels/default/swupdate-url
 - fix swupdate logs when using swdesc_pull_container (removed useless inspect
message)
 - make sure bolt_state.db is removed in persistent storage when using
non-standard paths. Podman refuses to start if we leave it behind.
 - improve changed file detection; in particular make sure we resign files
if certificate or key changed.

feature:
 - add compatibility with abos-base 1.12-r0:
    - preserve containers storage.conf additionalimagestore setting
    - write directly in persistent development storage if it is in use.
 - improve logs when updating in persistent storage case
 - allow multiple identical swdesc_exec in same swu if arguments differ.
This is useful for using the same swdesc_script with different parameters,
as can be done when using multiple desc files that update preserve files
 - handle swdesc from stdin as '-' as done by other software
 - add support for installing swu in SD installer. This was already
technically possible with reboots, but we can now install extra swu
directly at the end of install without extra reboot.

4.5
===
fixes:
 - fix script not waiting for podman containers to stop properly
in podman-storage --disk mode

 -- 2022-09-26

4.4
===
breaking changes:
 - /boot/uboot_env.d env is always applied after every updates,
not only for boot image updates.

features:
 - `mkswu --genkey --aes` now can generate new keys. This interface
still might slightly change.
 - add uboot_env.d and machine-id to default preserve files
 - refuse to apply uboot env if no bootcmd is set, e.g. defaults
are lacking.
 - use podman stop instead of podman kill for containers update.
This gives a chance for containers to shut down cleanly before kill.

fixes:
 - remove a few referneces to mmcblk2, this fixes mkswu when eMMC is
at a different index.

 -- 2022-08-26

4.3
===
breaking changes:
 - mkswu --genkey will now prompt for new key creations if a key
already exists. Use --noprompt for non-interactive uses.

features:
 - setting UPDATE_CERTS in mkswu.conf will send certificates in
$PUBKEY to device's /etc/swupdate.pem
(this is set automatically when genkey command generates new keys)
 - initialize uboot env with content from /boot/uboot_env.d/* on
boot image updates, and provide a script to update env immediately

fixes:
 - fix atmark user password not being preserved on updates (broken
in 4.1)
 - POST_ACTION=container would sometimes fail to umount podman readonly
storage, leading to an extra reboot
 - post install script would sometimes fail to notice errors from podman
commands (cleanup only)

 -- 2022-07-25

4.2
===
breaking changes:
 - the atmark user will automatically be locked if it has no password
set. This reflects an update to rootfs for alpine 3.16.0-at.1
 - update swupdate.cfg loglevel to 3 (info) if it was previously set to 2
(warn). Running with warn would show no message at all with new version.

features:
 - improve log messages: new swupdate version allows us to be more expressive
with info and warning messages, so make use of these if available.
 - add second atmark public certificate to /etc/swupdate.pem if and only
if the first one was present
 - update swupdate_preserve_files to v4. This adds /etc/dnsmasq.d,
/etc/sysctl.d, /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf, /etc/runlevels/default/hostapd,
/etc/iptables/rules{,6}-save, /etc/runlevels/default/ip{,6}tables
 - improve guidance messages for hawkbit-compose setup_container.sh

4.1
===
breaking changes:
 - rename ENCRYPT_FS to ENCRYPT_USERFS. This option was never documented
but one example used it; using swdesc_option ensures an error happens if
it is used.
 - default atmark password for --init is now locked instead of root
password

fixes:
 - mkswu --init would generate an invalid 'atmark' user password
since version 3.15-at.2, fix it and make --init again correct it as well
 - forbid installing another update while reboot is in progress.
This would sometimes cause a new partial rootfs copy and reboot into
a broken system

features:
 - include mkswu version in a comment in sw-description, so version used
to generate swu can be checked later
 - add mkswu --show to display swu content
 - ROOTFS_FSTYPE will default to whatever current system is currently in
use, so does not need to be set in all updates.
 - similarly, disk encryption is now automatically replicated if rootfs
is currently encrypted
 - run fstrim on rootfs after install. This helps MMC performance a
little bit.

4.0
===
This release changes numbering system to unlink mkswu from baseos:
mkswu and baseos do not share a lifecycle and sharing version was
needless work.

fixes:
 - fix size/mtime check to consider real file and not symlink in case of
no encryption and already compressed files
 - sync and dismount installed system before flipping boot switch:
this ensures the system should not be broken if power is cut immediately
after boot switch/notification.
 - fix temporary cleanup of unused files

 -- 2022-04-27

3.15-at.6
=========
features:
 - add NOTIFY_STARTING_CMD, NOTIFY_FAIL_CMD, NOTIFY_SUCCESS_CMD handling
 - add swdesc_option for settings in sw-description (FORCE_VERSION and co)
setting environment variables directly is still supported.
Some of these options can also be set in /etc/atmark/baseos.conf with
MKSWU_ prefix when it makes sense to do so (e.g. NOTIFY_*_CMD or POST_ACTION)
 - do not reinstall "useless" updates when boot image needs updating as that
would wipe previous OS to rollback to.

experimental:
- add swdesc_boot_enc and swdesc_boot_linux for encrypted linux update.
These are still susceptible to change.

fixes:
 - check for all files size/mtime instead of just checking 'is newer' for
swdesc_files, compression and hash. This avoids hash mismatch errors
 - network connectivity check for hawkbit_register failed as script did not
have net_raw permission to ping. use nc instead.
 - fix copying boot image over to other partition, the image was not always
copied until the end

 -- 2022-04-25

3.15-at.5
=========
fixes:
 - fix install on very old swupdate where swupdate -g might not include /dev
 - fix podman_cleanup corner cases with infra image
 - fix sha256sum file not being updated properly sometimes (if zst archive
   changed without changing base file)

 -- 2022-04-08

3.15-at.4
=========
breaking change:
 - component, version and install_if variables are reset before parsing each
desc file. component is set to desc file name, the other two are emptied.

features:
 - allow setting ZSTD_CLEVEL to change compression level
 - log update contents to at-log and store last update partition to
/var/log/swupdate/last_update
 - add update_preserve_files.sh helper script to manage this file
 - allow trailing arguments for swdesc_script
 - set FW_UPDATE_IND after install unless no reboot is needed
 - add --extra-os swdesc_* switch that adds extra_os. to component
 - hawkbit-compose japanese translation

fixes:
 - PRIVKEY_PASS wasn't escaped properly
 - fix hawkbit service restart for POST=container updates with hawkbit

 -- 2022-03-24

3.15-at.3
=========
breaking changes:
 - rename hawkbit/create-updates.sh to hawkbit_push_update and install it
to bin dir

features:
 - add NO_PRESERVE_FILES option to skip handling copyback when using custom
rootfs
 - full rework of hawkbit container: use hawkbit-compose/setup_container.sh
to generate appropriate docker-compose.yml and config files

fixes:
 - fix sw-versions handling for board-specific updates (e.g. boot image) that
might generate multiple lines. This was harmless. Such duplicate lines will
also now be removed.
 - improve various error messages
 - do not try to wait for podman containers to stop if none were running
 - install base_os first if present in the image. This allows running
swdesc_exec or similar even if a base_os update is coming that would
previously fail because /target is empty

 -- 2022-02-18

3.15-at.2
=========
breaking changes:
 - desc files: disallow using the same component with multiple versions
previously the highest version would be kept for updating sw-versions, but
this is no longer manageable with install-if different.
- versions: disallow alnum mix in semver versions (e.g. 1.2.3-abc1),
Because swupdate ordering and sort -V have different behaviour there.
- versions: also check for previously incorrectly identical versions
when using install-if different (big numbers in semver, + part of semver)
- rename mkimage.sh to mkswu and roll all secondary scripts within it,
suggesting to use the mkswu package instead of running from git.
- rename mkimage.conf to mkswu.conf (this should be transparently converted)


features:
 - version management: allow different versions for same component if
installed in a different board section
 - swdesc_*: add --install-if {different,higher} option to force mode
This can be useful to get more coherent behaviour with hawkbit
 - swdesc_tar/files: make relative paths relative to
/var/app/rollback/volumes for non-os upates. forbid '../'s, and
also forbid relative paths for os.
 - Japanese translation if LC_MESSAGES is set to ja*, and add more
messages overall
 - add mkswu --init for first setup, which will guide user through
key generation and fill in initial_setup.desc
 - add mkswu --import to import previously existing config into
$HOME/mkswu
 - add mkswu --version
 - add debian package

fixes:
 - examples/kernel_update_plain: fix comment, add modules
 - swdesc_tar/files: create destination directory if absent
 - kill swupdate post-update instead of waiting for openrc
to do it with plenty of failure messages
 - podman_cleanup: relax failure conditions when image is missing
but container does not autostart or autopulls the image

 -- 2022-01-21

3.15-at.1
=========
breaking changes:
 - desc files: paths have been made relative to desc files

features:
 - genkey.sh: automatically create/update default config
 - swdesc_tar: add --preserve-attributes switch

fixes:
 - podman_cleanup: handle new pod option
 - swupdate_preserve_files: fix directory copy
 - scripts: handle new overlayfs properly
 - post_app: fix possible failure case where swap happened but we error into
reboot case, leading to double-swap
 - version managements: do not remove extra_os versions on base_os update
 - examples/initial_setup.desc: fix using wrong public key for /etc/swupdate.pem update

 -- 2021-12-21

3.14-at.2
=========
 - first public release

-- 2021-12-03

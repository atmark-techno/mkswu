breaking changes:
 - desc files: disallow using the same component with multiple versions
previously the highest version would be kept for updating sw-versions, but
this is no longer manageable with install-if different.
- versions: disallow alnum mix in semver versions (e.g. 1.2.3-abc1),
Because swupdate ordering and sort -V have different behaviour there.
- versions: also check for previously incorrectly identical versions
when using install-if different (big numbers in semver, + part of semver)
- rename mkimage.sh to mkswu and roll all secondary scripts within it,
suggesting to use the mkswu package instead of running from git.
- rename mkimage.conf to mkswu.conf (this should be transparently converted)


features:
 - version management: allow different versions for same component if
installed in a different board section
 - swdesc_*: add --install-if {different,higher} option to force mode
This can be useful to get more coherent behaviour with hawkbit
 - swdesc_tar/files: make relative paths relative to
/var/app/rollback/volumes for non-os upates. forbid '../'s, and
also forbid relative paths for os.
- Japanese translation if LC_MESSAGES is set to ja*
- add mkswu --init for first setup, which will guide user through
key generation and fill in initial_setup.desc
- add mkswu --import to import previously existing config into
$HOME/mkswu
- add mkswu --version

fixes:
 - examples/kernel_update_plain: fix comment, add modules
 - swdesc_tar/files: create destination directory if absent
 - kill swupdate post-update instead of waiting for openrc
 to do it with plenty of failure messages

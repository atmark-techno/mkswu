breaking changes:
 - desc files: disallow using the same component with multiple versions
previously the highest version would be kept for updating sw-versions, but
this is no longer manageable with install-if different.

features:
 - version management: allow different versions for same component if
installed in a different board section
 - swdesc_*: add --install-if {different,higher} option to force mode
This can be useful to get more coherent behaviour with hawkbit
 - swdesc_tar/files: make relative paths relative to
/var/app/rollback/volumes for non-os upates. forbid '../'s, and
also forbid relative paths for os.

fixes:
 - examples/kernel_update_plain: fix comment, add modules
 - swdesc_tar/files: create destination directory if absent
